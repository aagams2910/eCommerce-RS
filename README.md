# E-commerce Recommendation System

This repository contains implementation of various recommendation system approaches for an e-commerce platform. The project demonstrates different techniques to provide personalized product recommendations to users.

## Project Overview

The project implements three main types of recommendation systems:

1. **Rank-Based Product Recommendation**
   - Basic recommendation system based on product popularity
   - Implemented in `rank_based_product_recommendation.ipynb`
   - Recommends products based on overall ratings and review counts

2. **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**
   - Recommends products based on user similarity
   - Implemented in `User_based_collaborative_filtering.ipynb`
   - Finds similar users and recommends products they liked

3. **Model-Based Collaborative Filtering**
   - Advanced recommendation system using matrix factorization
   - Implemented in `Model_based_collaborative_filtering.ipynb`
   - Uses latent features to predict user-item interactions

4. **Combined Recommendation System**
   - Comprehensive implementation combining multiple approaches
   - Implemented in `ECommerce_Product_Recommendation_System.ipynb`
   - Provides hybrid recommendations using multiple techniques

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
